Our group meeting took place from 4-5 in the engineering library.


Goals: Develop code to calculate the area under the curve.

RoadBlocks; The integrate() function in R only takes in functions as inputs. We have a list of data points instead. As a result, we need to find a way to fit a function to the data points or use an estimation method. 

Solution: Bonghyun's expertise in coding enabled us to find the pracma package which easily calculates the area under the curve. It employs the trapezoid method in estimating this area given our data points.

Accomplishments:
1) Used the pracma package (practical numerical math functions) to calculate the area under the curve.
2) Have a basic area under the curve functiont hat can run on all the diagrams. It is simple and elegant, but could be better.

Next Steps: We have our entire rough draft of the analysis complete. Now we must clean it up and ensure it is reproducible, clean, and free of error
