Hey guys,

I got this email from Sam regarding the lss Management assignment. I think this task is doable although I do not know much about other collaborative programs. Let me know whatyou guys think and lets post ideas to a folder. I will be unable to attend class this week as I have scheduled all my interviews for deadweek in LA. I'll be avilable online, skye, google hamgout, etc.

Hey John,
I can't seem to find any way of figuring out who is in your analyzer subgroup. I want you guys to work on writing about tools that would be good to use in the future to make collaboration easier, and to make our process more effective. Think Asana type tools.

Please let me know if you think this is a good task, and get in contact with your group so you all can start working on it! Happy to talk if you have questions or concerns.
