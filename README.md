error_analyzers (Analyzer Group 1/3)
===============

This group was created on Novemeber 14 by two analyzer groups merging (groups 1 and 3). Group 1 had finished the ETAS model output that they had been working on and Group 3 was still in the process of considering and understanding error and how to evaluate it. The groups are merged to create a function to plot error diagrams. The group created a function to plot the errors of the ETAS and the MDA models and then take the area under those curves as to evaluate the efefctiveness of the model.
