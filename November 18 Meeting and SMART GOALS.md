===============

1) Created a directory on the GitHub paghe of all our contact informations.

SMART Goals
===============

Specific
===============
  Groups 1 and 3 are collaborating on improving on the existing Luen code to produce error diagrams. The problem we found with the existing code is that it is hardwired in R and lacks the reproducible aspect that this class emphasizes.
  
  Furthermore, we are going to create codes to produce error diagrams for Teresa's output. We are collaborating with them on what outputs they will produce and how we will create functions that are simple, easy to follow, and effective. 

  We will use the error diagrams to take the area under the curve and measure the efficacy of the models.
  
Measurable
===============
  We will monitor our progress by setting a timeline to achieve our goals. Our fist measurable task will be to create the pseudo code for Luen's code and for Teresa's code. 
  
  Once we have created the Pseudo code, we will improve upon the existing code, simplifying it until the code is reproducible for even the most novice of programmers. 
  
  We will get feedback from Teresa's group as we move along and improve upon the code if the output matches their vision.

Attainable
===============

  We have a group full of analyzers that know the material in depth, as well as programmers who can efficiently and effectively improve upon the existing code.
  
  Our timeline is roughly set as follows:
    1) Tuesday, November 19: Get everyone in both groups caught up to speed. We have created an email          thread and a localized Github page to accomplish this.
    2) Thursday, November 21: Create the full pseudo code and get feedback on the code
    3) Tuesday, November 26: Improve upon the code and get more feedback. We should have a good model to       diagram errors at this point.
    4) Thursday, November 28: Thanksgiving
    5) Tuesday, December 3: Test the models and generate areas under the curve.
    6) Thursday, December 5: Clean up results and prepare for the presentation
    7) Tuesday, December 10: Finzalize presentation 
    8) Thursday, December 12: Presentation!

Realistic
===============
  These goals are realistic as we have a very specific task, room for error, and a large consortium of inspired students. 
  
Timely
===============
    Our timeline is roughly set as follows:
    1) Tuesday, November 19: Get everyone in both groups caught up to speed. We have created an email          thread and a localized Github page to accomplish this.
