11-19-13 Class Notes

1) Have pseudo ready for to produce Luen's code.

2) Got feedback back from teresa's group on their progress and how we should visualize their code. They appear to have hit a roadblock and have suggested working on Luen's code until their project becomes more concrete.

3) Ran the pseudo code and it looks good 

4) Disi is attending Luen's conference for our group 

5) Finding functions to determine the areas under the curve for the error diagrams. There appears to be an integrate() function in R that does this easily.
