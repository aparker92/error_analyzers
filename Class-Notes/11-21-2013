THINGS WORKED ON

1. Assigned Tasks for all group members to complete by Tuesday (https://github.com/stat157/background/issues/42)
2. Researched ETAS Model output, trying to understand what the confidence interval means (see https://github.com/aparker92/error_analyzers/issues/3)
3. Started coding based on the pseudocode
4. Clarified the necessary understanding of ETAS: need to understand output for errors - not the whole model
