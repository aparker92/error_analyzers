Summary of class today
=========


1) Professor Stark visited class and listened to a presentation from the Quakers on the state of the project.A major takeaway from this is that he wants us to looks at triggers that are only set off after large earthquakes. We may need to adjust our model slightly to compare large earthquakes for ETAS and MDA.


2) Fernando Perez, creator of IPython, gavce a talk to the class about the virtues od IPython and reproducibility.


Gameplan
=========

1) While the coding aspects won't be too hard, we still need to get everyone on exactly the same page. Maybe we can do this through a Google Hangout or meeting early next week with everyone in the group?
