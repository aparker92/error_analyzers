One of the greatest lessons of this course is the importance of reproducibility and collaboration. As a class we learned that group-work is not as simple as it may seem, epecially when working in parallel with other groups. Furthermore, as unpredicted problems emerge, the road to the final product becomes obscured. It is easy to stray off task, get frustrated, and lose motivation at points. The following are the steps and tools we can use in the future to more effectively collaborate:

Steps:
  1) Create a means of communication so that everyone can communicate easily. This includes setting up a GitHub, Facebook, IRC, Skype, Google Hangouts, Join.me,etc. Communication may be the hardest and most important.
  2) Create a central working location where you can upload your work. This will keep everyone up to date and allow for better methods of troubleshooting/constructive criticism. These tools can include GitHub, Asana, Ipython Notebook, GoogleDocs, etc.
  3) Before starting any work, write out the long-term goals and short-term milestones. Update this frequently as it is important to be realistic as well clear on your goals.
  4) Start work
  5) Continue updating goals and communicating.
