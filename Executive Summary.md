Objectives
===============
To make Luen's error code diagrams more reproducible and to analyze the area under the curves.

Methods
===============
We combined groups 1 and 3 to formulate this new group. We merged these groups around November 19th as both groups felt the need to add more work. As our two groups finished early, we decided to improve the reproducibility of Luen's code as well as take our analysis one step further and integrate the area beneath the curve for the error diagrams. This area under the curve signified the number of false positives, so minimizing this area is paramount to creating a more efficient model.

Accomplishments
===============
As of December 3, we have rewritten Luen's code that made ETAS error diagrams so that it is more reproducible and we have generalized the function so that it can take in multiple data sets. We have created another function that calculates the area under the curve of the error diagrams in order to measure the accuracy of the models.
